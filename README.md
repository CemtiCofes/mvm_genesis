## Important Notice
Restart the wave if any of this happens:
- Engineers won't spawn. This caused by bugs on Engineer's spawn point. This usually happens when the bomb carrier is between the gates and Gate A has been captured. To prevent this, you have to avoid gatebots from capturing the Gate A.
  
- Bots stuck in starting gate. Sometimes bots can get stuck in the starting gate. This usually happens when a bot is below the starting gate when it's about to be closed.
